# 🚀 Real-Time Image Classification with Inference Latency Analysis Using Pretrained Deep Learning Models

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **real-time image classification system** with a strong emphasis on **neural network inferencing performance**. A user uploads an image through a web interface, the system classifies the image using a **pretrained deep learning model**, and displays both the **predicted class** and the **time taken (latency)** to generate the prediction.

The core objective of this project is **not model training**, but **efficient inference and performance evaluation**, which is a critical requirement in real-world AI systems.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

* Perform **image classification** using a pretrained deep learning model
* Measure **real-time inference latency** in milliseconds
* Demonstrate **optimized inferencing concepts** used in production AI systems
* Provide a **clean, app-like user interface** for interaction
* Bridge the gap between **AI theory and AI engineering**

---

## 🧠 System Workflow

1. User uploads an image via the web interface
2. Image is preprocessed (resize, normalization)
3. Pretrained **ResNet-50** model performs inference
4. The system predicts the object class from **ImageNet (1000 classes)**
5. Inference time (latency) is calculated
6. Result is displayed with:

   * Uploaded image preview
   * Predicted class
   * Confidence score
   * Inference latency

## ⚡ Role of Optimization Technologies

Although inference is demonstrated locally using PyTorch, this project is conceptually designed around **industry-grade optimization tools**:

* **TensorRT** – Optimizes trained neural networks for high-speed inference on GPUs
* **Triton Inference Server** – Enables scalable and efficient deployment of optimized models

These technologies significantly reduce inference latency in production environments and are widely used in real-time AI applications.

## 📊 Sample Results

* **Predicted Class:** Egyptian Cat / Beagle (ImageNet classes)
* **Confidence:** ~65–80%
* **Inference Latency:** ~150–450 ms (CPU-based inference)

> ⚠️ Latency is higher on CPU. With GPU + TensorRT optimization, latency can reduce to **single-digit milliseconds**.
